This project contains documents I've written in plain-text used to
generate my [[https://rwest.io][website]] and readmes for code hosted at [[https://hg.rwest.io//][hg.rwest.io]].

- [[https://hg.rwest.io/meta][src]] <-

- =m.org= contains formal docs for projects
- =n.org= contains informal notes
- =cv.org= is my resume (hire me!)

** tmp
First we generate the output directory and copy the source files
there. This ensures the root project directory isn't polluted on
export.

You could also do an initial export to generate pre-parsed files (with
comments and headings tagged with =noexport= removed) in the output
directory instead of copying the raw source. This is great for docs
with sensitive info, but I prefer the copy method for public projects.

#+name: meta-tmp
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ((path (concat o "org/"))
        (files (list "m.org" "n.org" "index.org" "cv.org" "ox.setup")))
    (make-directory path t)
    (dolist (f files)
      (copy-file f path t))
    (message "created meta-tmp dir"))
#+end_src

** pub
- Org has integrated [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][exporting]] powered by [[https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/ox-docstrings.html][ox.el]] - an
  emacs-lisp script is all that is needed to generate conventional
  formats like HTML, Markdown, PDF, and txt.
- Exported files are saved in separate directories

** pack
First we clean some of the junk latex produced by the PDF export.

#+name: meta-clean-latex-clutter
#+begin_src sh
  cd $o/org && rm -rf *.pdf *.tex
#+end_src

Now we can compress our exports to =.tz= (tar.zst) archives.

#+name: meta-pack
#+begin_src sh
  cd o/
  for i in $(find ./* -maxdepth 0 -type d);
  do
      shc pack $i
  done
#+end_src
** docs
Generate API docs for all Rust projects
#+name: shed-gen-rust-docs
#+begin_src sh
  WD=$SHED/src
  O=$WD/meta/o/d
  cd $WD
  for i in rlib tenex shed; do # shed
      cd $i
      cargo +nightly doc --target-dir $O --no-deps --all-features --workspace --release --message-format short
      cd ..
  done
  cd $O
  mv doc/* ./ && rm -r doc release
#+end_src
** deploy
- all build artifacts are transferred over SSH to a public web server
- New content can now be viewed online at [[https://rwest.io][rwest.io]] and downloaded at
  [[https://rwest.io/x][rwest.io/x]] which includes archives and individual files in all
  formats.

* syntax
The source files assume some familiarity with org syntax. Org syntax
is covered [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][online]] in detail and high-level info about document
structure can be found in the [[info:emacs#Top][Emacs manual]].

[[https://rwest.io/a/img/org-mode-features_display.png]]

All docs are fully compliant with org, with the addition of some
special *elements*:

- props :: \\
  - All nodes have an optional number of =props= which are simply list
    items starting with =+= followed by the =prop-key= an assignment
    operator (=--=, =<-=, =->=), and a =prop-val=.
    #+begin_example
      # [+] [KEY] [OP] [VAL]
      + what -- an example
    #+end_example
  - the =prop-val= type is determined by the operator. It can be a
    string =--=, list =->=, or empty =<-=.
  - =props= can appear anywhere in the =section= element of a node
    (not just immediately following properties drawer). With the
    condition that they can't be embedded (props in =prop-val=).
- drawers :: \\
     Org-mode has a feature called drawers, which are collapsible
     sections of text starting with =:DRAWER_NAME:= and ending with
     =:END:=. The most common one seen in our docs is the PROPERTIES
     drawer, but there are a few special ones we use, especially in
     =n.org=: =note=, =opinion=, =props= =boris=.
- links :: 
     In addition to the default links, we use a few custom links, most
     notably =yt= which embeds a video from youtube.
     :note:
     This is not good for users, since the embedded youtube links include
     tracking and other nasty bits from Google. In the future these links
     will be migrated to =cdn= to avoid that, increasing user privacy and
     greatly improving page load time.
     :END:
     =cdn=, =src=, and =rw= links all point to =rwest.io=.
