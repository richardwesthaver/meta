- by /artform/, we mean the decided /formal/ organization of a work or set
  of works. An /Album/ is a form of Music, for example. A /Book/ is a
  form of writing.
- Art, in my mind, is one of the crowning achievements of humanity. Like
  olives or wine, a taste for it is acquired with time, and although
  /works/ of Art are often consumed by our senses, they are compelling
  for reasons which are much harder to define.
- It has been a fruitless effort, attempting to break down the
  underlying /algorithm/ of which Art is composed. Some of the oldest
  western definitions can be found in the works of Plato, specifically
  Book X of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)][The Republic]], where Socrates argues that art is /imitation/
  (a representation of something else). This limited definition has
  naturally developed, and today there is a vast cluster of
  'definitions', which tends to complicate everyone's understanding of
  what it is that they are talking about, more than anything else.

- Computer Programming
  #+begin_quote
  Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
  executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result
  or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as:
  analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
  resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen
  programming language (commonly referred to as coding).

- It is clear that the future of organized web development is
  embedded in the Cloud. :(
  - Github, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.. are all excellent
    tools.
  - These services become a core part of your deployment pipeline,
    many of them are quite complex. The features you use are likely
    to be based on a subscription (monthly/yearly fee),
    pay-as-you-go model (/Gb, /Hr), or even through a third-party
    extension (/gasp/).
  - These factors lead to a new level of meta-programming in which
    you create hacks to support your workflow, reduce costs, and
    integrate with your internal infrastructure. This is the 10th
    circle of Hell in which engineers and network specialists need
    to Read The Docs and become subject matter experts themselves.
  - Is there a better way?
    - For conventional orgs, probably not.
    - For the one-man army or isolated tribe of hackers.. perhaps.
      - Build it yourself!
      - Own your data.
      - Develop in distributed silos or 'labs'.
      - Self-host services.

    Object-oriented Programming (OOP for short) is a programming model
    that organizes code around /objects/, and emphasizes the focus on
    objects that we want to manipulate, rather than the functions and
    logic necessary to manipulate them.

    - Objects
      Objects can be definied as data fields that have /unique attributes
      and behavior/. They are most often identified through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling][data modeling]],
      which is the practice of organizing an Information system by applying
      a variety of formal techniques.

Nowadays it is often useful to write unit tests which accompany core
source code. A unit test is a /language-agnostic/ module that is
responsible for determing whether or not a piece of source code is fit
for use. They are often written in the same directories, or even the
same files that source code is written in, although this depends on
the given programming language.

The piece of source code that is tested can be referred to as a
=unit=, which is a neutral enough term. Another way to think of it is
as the =scope= that is given to the unit test, or the code that is
=executed= by a unit test.

When tech guys chatter about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage][code coverage]], I understand it as the
relative amount of code that is "covered" by unit tests compared to
the amount of code that is not (but I've also heard it referred to as
a measure of documentation?  meh).

Naturally we like to shoot for perfection, and have every snippet of
code we write be covered by a unit test, but this isn't always
practical. Software deployments consisting of hand-made code are
increasing in frequency at a rapid rate (which is /awesome/). Amazon,
for example, was deploying new code to production every 11.7 seconds
on average [[https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/data-culture-survey-results-faster-deployment/][as early as 2016]]. How are we supposed to keep up?? There's
no way we can demand that developers maintain an up-to-date branch of
the production code base after all..

In my opinion, the most scaleable solution, which is also employed at
many companies with a strong web presence, is through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture][system architecture]].

  Agent-based models (ABM) are computer programs that define agents,
  virtual entities that imitate the decision-making processes and
  interactions of real people, animals, neurons, computers, or other
  individuals. ABMs have a wide range of applications. For example, an
  ABM can study a flock of birds. The behavior of each virtual bird can
  be as simple as just trying to fly in close proximity to the nearest
  neighbor; the software can show that this birds combine their behavior
  to generate the complex, adaptive patterns of flight of real
  flocks. An ABM can also study economic behavior: in a virtual society,
  sellers of goods set a price based on limited information they have
  about the market, and buyers may bargain based on their own limited
  information about the market. Even with simple rules, an economic ABM
  can generate complex patterns that can be useful to understand real
  macroeconomic trends.

[...] System programming is the practice of
writing system software. System software lives at a low level,
interfacing directly with the kernel and core system libraries. Your
shell and your text editor, your compiler and your debugger, your core
utilities and system daemons are all system software. But so are the
network server, the web server, and the database. These components are
entirely system software, primarily if not exclusively interfacing
with the kernel and the C library. Other software (such as high-level
GUI applications) lives at a higher level, delving into the low level
only on occasion. Some programmers spend all day every day writing
system software; others spend only part of their time on this
task. There is no programmer, however, who does not benefit from an
understanding of system programming. Whether it is the programmer’s
raison d'être, or merely a foundation for higher-level concepts,
system programming is at the heart of all software that we write.

**** Vulnerability Assessment

:END:
- The vulnerability assessment of a computer system involves
  identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities. This is
  an important step for both offensive and defensive measures in risk
  assessment.
- This is often an ongoing process that is performed on a schedule
  within the network security team. Systems change, new features are
  added, new exploits are discovered, so it's important to keep up.
- One of the most important defensive tools you have as a network
  admin is logging and analyzing network traffic, but it is far more
  important to be pro-active with your analysis. There seems to be a
  lot of orgs out there that save inspection of network traffic until
  /after/ their customer DB has been exfiltrated for months on end.
  - Don't wait for an active attack to start learning how to analyze
    your traffic. By then it is far too late and defeats the purpose
    of having logging in the first place. It help you identify way
    more potential vulnerabilities, really understand your network,
    and secure your assets AOT.

- Networks are also not the only type of computer system that requires
  vulnerability assessment, it's just the one that is often most
  exposed. Software applications and libraries, communication and
  cryptographic protocols, and hardware are all fair game. The term
  itself is generic and applies to systems that are far more difficult
  to assess such as energy supply and transportation systems.

In computer programming, an indentation style is a convention

#+end_quote
- I personally prefer 2-space indent just about everywhere. spaces >
  tabs, but 4 spaces is too much.
  - There are exceptions to this of course - Emacs-lisp is a big one
    considering that best-practice is often to vertically align
    elements.

    For example, this is considered good formatting:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(format "%a %b"
	thing1
	thing2)
    #+end_src
    And this is bad formatting:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(format "%a %b"
 thing1
 thing2)
    #+end_src
    
    In fact, adding my strict 2-space preference would be even /worse/
    formatting.

  - Makefiles are another good example. the =TAB= character is the
    default indent, so you can either accept it or add an assignment
    for the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables][special variable]] =.RECIPEPREFIX= that gets added to all of
    your Makefiles. I go for the former since it has better
    integration with IDEs (which often expect TABs and may warn you
    about invalid syntax, despite the =.RECIPEPREFIX= assignment)

Arena allocation is a memory management technique where a set of
objects have the same lifetime and can be deallocated at the same
time. An arena is an object responsible for allocating and
deallocating the memory. Since large chunks of memory are allocated
and deallocated at once (rather than allocating individual objects),
arena allocation is very efficient. Usually, all the objects are
allocated from a contiguous chunk of memory, that improves cache
coherency when you are traversing the graph.

  first step is to clone the repo and take a peak at the examples.

  - clone repo & compile static_lib

  #+begin_src sh :exports code
git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb && cd rocksdb
make static_lib
cd examples/; make all
  #+end_src

  the examples don't output anything to stdout when they're run, but many of them store database files under a directory in =/tmp= which can be inspected. after compiling the library in the root you get a =make_config.mk= which is include'd in =examples/makefile=. worth checking out to get a better understanding of how examples are compiled (with g++).

  let's take a look at the output of options_file_example:

  #+begin_src sh :exports both :eval never-export
cd ./media/01/rocksdb_options_file_example && ls
  #+end_src

  #+results:
  | 000012.log               |
  | CURRENT                  |
  | IDENTITY                 |

  | OPTIONS-000009           |
  | OPTIONS-000014           |

  The LOG file looks like this:

  After poking around in the wiki for a bit and learning about the
  [[https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Basic-Operations][Basic Operations]], we can build a helloworld-db tool of our own for
  testing. We'll also make a simple Makefile that compiles our code
  with [[https://clang.llvm.org/][Clang]]. We're not going to do much with this program right now
  since the [[https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/tree/master/examples][examples]] and [[https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki][wiki]] provide plenty of reading material.
  
  - helloworld.cc

    boneless =simple_example.cc= from the examples

     #+begin_src cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "rocksdb/db.h"
#include "rocksdb/options.h"

using namespace rocksdb;

std::string db_path = "infodb";
DB* db;
Options options;
	
void run() {
	options.IncreaseParallelism();
	options.OptimizeLevelStyleCompaction();
	options.create_if_missing = true;		
	Status s = DB::Open(options, db_path, &db);
	assert(s.ok());

	std::string value;	
  s = db->Get(ReadOptions(), "some_key", &value);
  assert(s.IsNotFound());
}

int main() {
	run();
	
	delete db;
	return 0;
}
      #+end_src

    - Makefile

      compile =helloworld.cc= with Clang, link rocksdb dynamically
      (for now). We can see the linked .so files with =ldd
      ./helloworld= command after compiling.

      #+begin_src makefile
	.PHONY: clean
	_: compile
	compile: helloworld.cc
		clang++ -Wall helloworld.cc -ohelloworld -lrocksdb

	clean:
		rm -rf helloworld
      #+end_src

    After compiling with ~make~ and running ~./helloworld~ we get some
    files dumped to ~./infodb~ with the same structure as the
    examples.
***** Column Families
:PROPERTIES:

:CUSTOM_ID: column-families
:END:

  [[https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Column-Families][Column Families]] are a feature of RocksDB that allows us to logically
  partition our database. HOWEVER, these are not 'columns' as they are
  known in relational databases. Column Families are simply a new
  namespace for key:val pairs. If we implement our Column Families
  correctly , we can /build/ a full database model, relational or
  otherwise. These features are what makes embedded key:val stores
  like RocksDB unique - they are *primitive*, and allow developers an
  insane level of flexibility in their implementations.

  Going forward, how we partition our database through Column Families
  will play an important role in how useful it is, and how easily we
  can build additional layers of processing and API on top of it.

  For now, we'll just take a peek at [[https://github.com/indradb/indradb][IndraDB]] and how Column Families
  are used in their implementation to store [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)][Graph]] data structures.

****** IndraDB Implementation

   IndraDB is a Graph Database library written in Rust. It's heavily
   inspired by [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/courses/fall2013/static/papers/11730-atc13-bronson.pdf][TAO]] (an excellent read btw) and allows for arbitrary
   /Properties/ to be stored with any Node or Edge. IndraDB supports
   quite a few different backends, but we're only interested in the
   RocksDB impl, more specifically, [[https://github.com/indradb/indradb/tree/master/lib/src/rdb][lib/src/rdb]]. The column family
   names can be found in [[https://github.com/indradb/indradb/blob/master/lib/src/rdb/datastore.rs][datastore.rs]]:

   #+begin_src rust
const CF_NAMES: [&str; 6] = [
    "vertices:v1",
    "edges:v1",
    "edge_ranges:v1",
    "reversed_edge_ranges:v1",
    "vertex_properties:v1",
    "edge_properties:v1",
];
   #+end_src

   =vertices=, =edges=, =edge_ranges=, and =reversed_edge_ranges= are
   directly derived from the TAO Model. =vertex_properties= and
   =edge_properties= represent encoded JSON objects (i.e. properties)
   that can be attached to =vertices= and =edges=. The first four
   Column Families are all we need to create the TAO Graph
   implementation so we'll focus on those and set aside properties.

   *Vertices* are ("vertex_id" : "vertex_type") and *Edges* are
   ("edge_id" : "edge_type"), but what are 'edge_ranges' and
   'reversed_edge_ranges'? The answer is evident when we consider what
   we actually get from =vertices= and =edges=. We get a single k/v
   pair, but no way to connect them, which makes them pretty useless
   by themselves. *edge_ranges* can be thought of as /associations/
   between *vertices*, /indexed by time of insertion/. It boils down to
   a k/v pair, but the key is a struct that looks like this:

   #+begin_src rust
pub struct EdgeKey {
    /// The id of the outbound vertex.
    pub outbound_id: Uuid,

    /// The type of the edge.
    pub t: Type,

    /// The id of the inbound vertex.
    pub inbound_id: Uuid,
}
   #+end_src

   and the value is a timestamp, resulting in a single Edge pair
   being:

   #+begin_src rust
pub struct Edge {
    /// The key to the edge.
    pub key: EdgeKey,

    /// When the edge was created.
    pub created_datetime: DateTime<Utc>,
}
   #+end_src

   These Edges (or /associations/) can be found in both the
   edge_ranges and reversed_edge_ranges column families, with the
   /reversed/ associations being derived from the same EdgeKey struct
   but with the *outbound and inbound ids swapped*. This allows us to
   create /bidirectional/ edges (as well as support parts of the TAO
   model, but not worth getting into here).

The kernel is micro-kernel based, which uses the principle of least authority, preferring code to be ran in user space instead of kernel space. This architecture /usually/ leads to a variable level of performance degradation due to the additional context switches between the kernel and user handlers. My current thinking is that there are some clever solutions to the problem of context switching, but I need to further understand where and how often (during which syscalls) they occur, and what the impact is. Anyways in short this 'micro-kernel' is slow, but it is only 16k lines which is insane compared to Linux's 25MILLION

  Still need panic_handler and =eh_personality= language item which marks a function used for [[https://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/stackunwinding.php][stack unwinding]]. Stack unwinding is rather complex, and is typically provided by OS (Windows structured exception handling and Linux libunwind).

  The following in =Cargo.toml= will enable abort on panic, which effectively disables stack unwinding.

  panic = "abort"

  [profile.release]
  panic = "abort"

  At this point in the guide we are getting yet another error =error: requires `start` lang_item=

  start is the marker for the entry point of the program, for typical std rust apps this involves the =crt0= library "C Runtime zero". We need to overwrite the crt0 entry point directly.
  Another attribute is needed: #![no_main]

  The next step involves resolving a linker error - which happens because of the rust compiler target (usually a C runtime like Windows Mac Linux). What we want is a bare metal target with /none/ for a runtime value. We will be building a [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/custom.html][custom target]] instead of the example value below, which is actually for an embedded ARM system.

  The implementation in this tutorial uses BIOS, which has since been proceeded by UEFI. The benefit of BIOS is that it is 'simpler' and runs on almost every machine on the market today, but UEFI is the new fad, and faster. The gh issue is [[https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/issues/349][here]].

  -- Side note - check out this [[https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/blob/master/uefi-test-runner/build.py][build.py]] used in the uefi-rs crate test-runner

  [[https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage][bootimage]] provides a tool that automatically prepends a bootloader to our kernel.

  - So far we've added all the boiler plate needed to get a Hello World! message in QEMU via =cargo run=
- VGA Text Mode
  A typical VGA text buffer is 25x80
  It is available at memory register 0xb8000 via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O][memory-mapped I/O]]
  volatile crate ensures that our read and writes in vga_buffer::Writer aren't optimized away by the compiler
  - intro to spinlocks
    spin provides a spinning mutex (Mutex primitive for OS-less environments)
- Testing
  added a basic test runner with a Qemu wrapper to properly exit the kernel once test complete
  - next step is to print to the host console - to do this we need an interface to send the data over, there are many ways that we could do this, TCP, UDP, etc.. but these all require significant configuration, especially on a bare-metal machine. In this tutorial we're going to use a serial port, more specifically UART16550 in =serial.rs=.
    For this to work as a console printer, we need to specify the /first/ serial port number, from which the other UART ports can be implicitly defined. 0x3F8 is the standard first port in x86. We add =serial_print!= and =serial_println!= macros for usability in serial.rs.

    We also added a custom panic handler for tests that uses serial_print instead of print, plus removed the GUI so that we can run without opening a QEMU display

    started a /tests/ directory specifically for /integration tests/. see basic_boot for example, basically it's like a separate executable where you need to link to the modules you want to test

    Also began refactoring into a lib.rs :^O bout time

    We now have a decent test framework!
- Exceptions
  The CPU throws exceptions when rules are broken with the current instruction. For example when dividing by zero. Our goal in this tutorial is to be able to create [[https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Breakpoint][breakpoints]] and resume execution of the OS after handling them.
  There are about 20 exception types in x86 but the most important are:
  #+begin_quote
  
    - Page Fault: A page fault occurs on illegal memory accesses. For
      example, if the current instruction tries to read from an
      unmapped page or tries to write to a read-only page.
    - Invalid Opcode: This exception occurs when the current
      instruction is invalid, for example when we try to use newer SSE
      instructions on an old CPU that does not support them.
    - General Protection Fault: This is the exception with the
      broadest range of causes. It occurs on various kinds of access
      violations such as trying to execute a privileged instruction in
      user level code or writing reserved fields in configuration
      registers.
    - Double Fault: When an exception occurs, the CPU tries to call
      the corresponding handler function. If another exception occurs
      while calling the exception handler, the CPU raises a double
      fault exception. This exception also occurs when there is no
      handler function registered for an exception.
    - Triple Fault: If an exception occurs while the CPU tries to call
      the double fault handler function, it issues a fatal triple
      fault. We can't catch or handle a triple fault. Most processors
      react by resetting themselves and rebooting the operating
      system.

  #+end_quote
  - To handle exceptions, we need to create an Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). The hardware uses this table, so we need to use a pre-defined format.
    Each entry must have the following 16-byte structure:

    List of all exceptions: https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions

  When an exception occurs, the CPU roughly does the folowing:
  #+begin_quote
    1. Push some registers on the stack, including the instruction pointer and the RFLAGS register. (We will use these values later in this post.)
    2. Read the corresponding entry from the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). For example, the CPU reads the 14-th entry when a page fault occurs.
    3. Check if the entry is present. Raise a double fault if not.
    4. Disable hardware interrupts if the entry is an interrupt gate (bit 40 not set).
    5. Load the specified GDT selector into the CS segment.
    6. Jump to the specified handler function.

  When this code is ran, the QEMU will enter a boot loop. Why? because a Triple Fault is triggered, since no Double Fault Handler has yet been defined. The double fault is triggered when no page fault handler is found :).
  NOTE: Double fault functions are [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/fn/diverging.html][Diverging]].

    definition of double fault, (sum): “double fault exception can occur when a second exception occurs during the handling of a prior (first) exception handler”. The can is important. The exact combinations of first and second exception handlers are defined as:

  So [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment][TSS]] does need to be implemented - in x86_64 TSS doesn't hold any task-related information. Instead it holds the Privilege Stack Table [u64; 3], Interrupt Stack Table [u64; 7], I/O Map Base Address u16.
  - At this stage we ignore the PST since we don't have any user programs yet.
  we will implement a TSS in gdt.rs.
  - keep in mind - stacks in x86 grow downwards.

  - GDT = [[https://web.archive.org/web/20190217233448/https://www.flingos.co.uk/docs/reference/Global-Descriptor-Table/][Global Descriptor Table]]
    It is mostly used for two things: Switching between kernel space and user space, and loading a TSS structure.

  - The Final Steps
    #+begin_quote
    In summary, we need to do the following:
    1. Reload code segment register: We changed our GDT, so we should reload cs, the code segment register. This is required since the old segment selector could point a different GDT descriptor now (e.g. a TSS descriptor).
    2. Load the TSS : We loaded a GDT that contains a TSS selector, but we still need to tell the CPU that it should use that TSS.
    3. Update the IDT entry: As soon as our TSS is loaded, the CPU has access to a valid interrupt stack table (IST). Then we can tell the CPU that it should use our new double fault stack by modifying our double fault IDT entry.

    The 8259 PIC is significantly easier to set up than the APIC so it's used in this guide.

    Each controller can be configured through two I/O ports, one “command” port and one “data” port. For the primary controller these ports are 0x20 (command) and 0x21 (data). For the secondary controller they are 0xa0 (command) and 0xa1 (data).

  - Keyboard interrupts
    In this section we set up a keyboard event handler which accepts a keycode, and translates that using a few utility crates.
- Paging
  Memory protection is one of the primary tasks of an operating system. The system should use hardware functionality to make sure program A can not access the memory registers of program B. x86 supports two different approaches to memory protection: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation][segmentation]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory#Paged_virtual_memory][paging]]
  - segmentation was introduced in 1978 to increase the amount of effective memory a system could use, via /virtual memory/ - which was implemented via offset registers.
    
    The idea behind virtual memory is to abstract away the memory addresses from the underlying physical storage device. The virtual memory is /before/ translation, the physical memory is /after/ translation.
    using a single offset can cause fragmentation - where there is not enough /continuous/ memory available to create a virtual memory register. This could be fixed by pausing and moving the pre-existing virtual memory registers closer together, then adding the next. This causes v bad performance though due to all the copies, and thus isn't even supported in 64_bit mode of x86. Paging is used instead which completely avoids the problem of fragmentation.
  - paging

    paging involves dividing memory into smaller chunks, where the block in virtual memory are called /pages/ and the blocks in physical memory are called /frames/. Internal fragmentation can still occur (as opposed to /external/ fragmentation, which occurs in segmentation), for example if we set a page size of 50 bytes, and a program of size 101, we would still need 3 pages and thus 49 unused bytes.
    #+DOWNLOADED: https://os.phil-opp.com/paging-introduction/paging-fragmentation.svg @ 2020-11-23 15:33:33
    [[file:media/2020-11-23_15-33-33_paging-fragmentation.svg]]
  - pagetables are a data structure that stores mapping information
    each program instance has its own pagetable which maps pages to frames
    we can also have multi-level nested pagetables, where we simply add table pointers to optimize path to physical memory
  - x86_64 used a 4-level page table and a page size of 4KiB. each page table, regardless of level, has a fixed size of 512 entries. each entry has a size of 8 bytes (512*8B = 4KiB).
    bytes need to be discarded and left alone to ensure uniqueness of memory address. This is called /sign-extension/ and allows for future extensions like 5-level page tables (which is an optional feature of the recent "Ice Lake" Intel CPUs). NOTE: all page table entries are on physical memory to avoid infinite recursion.
  - the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is used to store the last few memory address translations. This allows us to skip the translation if the result is already cached. The TLB needs to be manually managed by the kernel whenever it modifies a page table. There is a special CPU instruction called =invlpg= (invalidate page) that removes a translation from the TLB. The TLB can also be flushed completely by reloading the CR3
  - Implementation - we actually already have paging implemented at this stage, via our bootloader.
    first we add a page fault handler, to be thrown instead of generic double fault.
- Paging Implementation
  in this post we implement paging support in our kernel. As of last post, we were unable to access page tables because they are in physical memory frames.
  
  there are many ways to implement page table mappings:
  - /Identity Mapping/ - a 1:1 mapping from virtual to physical

  - /Map at fixed offset/ - for example Physical address = 4KiB, virtual = 4KiB + 1TiB
    Note that the virtual address space needs to be larger than PhysicalMem+Offset, which isn't a problem on x86_64 with 48-bit address space = 256 TiB large

  - /Map the complete physical memory/ - instead of only page table frames
    #+begin_quote
    This approach allows our kernel to access arbitrary physical memory, including page table frames of other address spaces. The reserved virtual memory range has the same size as before, with the difference that it no longer contains unmapped pages.

    The disadvantage of this approach is that additional page tables are needed for storing the mapping of the physical memory. These page tables need to be stored somewhere, so they use up a part of physical memory, which can be a problem on devices with a small amount of memory.

    On x86_64, however, we can use huge pages with size 2MiB for the mapping, instead of the default 4KiB pages. This way, mapping 32 GiB of physical memory only requires 132 KiB for page tables since only one level 3 table and 32 level 2 tables are needed. Huge pages are also more cache efficient since they use fewer entries in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
    #+end_quote

  - /Temporary Mapping/ - reuses a single page table of 512 bytes, so only required 4KiB, but can be cumbersome since each new mapping might require modifications of multiple table levels
    #+begin_quote
    - Search for a free entry in the identity-mapped level 1 table.
    - Map that entry to the physical frame of the page table that we want to access.
    - Access the target frame through the virtual page that maps to the entry.
    - Set the entry back to unused thereby removing the temporary mapping again.
    #+end_quote

  - /Recursive Page Tables/ - Another interesting approach, that requires no additional page tables at all, is to map the page table recursively. The idea behind this approach is to map some entry of the level 4 page table to the level 4 table itself. By doing this, we effectively reserve a part of the virtual address space and map all current and future page table frames to that space. This is tricky and not implemented in this tutorial, but we should check out the Address Calculation section for more details.

  After all this we do some implementation, end up being able to set up fresh page table with a correct allocator.
- Heap Allocation
  At this point we just copied the tutorial code into our src, just to align with the conventions used. At the end of this post all the allocation and collection types of the built-in [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/index.html][alloc]] crate will be available in our kernel.

  Our kernel currently uses two types of variables, static and local. Static variables are stored at a fixed memory location and are available for the lifetime of our kernel. Local variables are stored on the
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack][call stack]] = [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)][stack data structure]] that supports =push= and =pop= operations.
  
  static variables are encoded directly into the executable and are read only by default. We can modify it using a Mutex though, which allows for a single =&mut= reference to use the variable at a time, passing it around like hot potato. We already use a =Mutex= for our static VGA buffer Writer for example.
  in addition to static and local:
  #+begin_quote
  programming languages often support a third memory region for storing variables called the heap. The heap supports dynamic memory allocation at runtime through two functions called allocate and deallocate. It works in the following way: The allocate function returns a free chunk of memory of the specified size that can be used to store a variable. This variable then lives until it is freed by calling the deallocate function with a reference to the variable.
  #+end_quote

  The alloc crate which is bundled with the Rust compiler requires some annotations, such as for a static that implements the =GlobalAlloc= trait which is declared as:
  #+begin_src rust
  pub unsafe trait GlobalAlloc {
    unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8;
    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout);

    unsafe fn alloc_zeroed(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 { ... }
    unsafe fn realloc(
        &self,
        ptr: *mut u8,
        layout: Layout,
        new_size: usize
    ) -> *mut u8 { ... }
  }
  #+end_src

  - we use the linked_list_allocator crate, but will dive into different heap allocation designs in the next chapter. In the remainder, we implement some tests and show usage of the alloc collections.
- Allocator Designs
  The responsibility of an allocator is to manage the available heap memory.
  - Bump Allocator
    most simple design - known as a /stack allocator/. It allocates linearly and only keeps track of the number of allocated bytes and the number of allocations.
    The main advantage of bump allocators is /performance/. It's used in things like Virtual DOMs, but is rarely used in kernel memory allocation. [[https://mgravell.github.io/Pipelines.Sockets.Unofficial/docs/arenas.html][Arena Allocation]] does borrow the concept though, so it's useful to consider. This is a Rust-based arena allocator: [[https://docs.rs/toolshed/0.8.1/toolshed/index.html][toolshed]]
    The downside is of course that we can't re-use previously allocated registers without clearing all memory from the heap.
  - Linked List Allocator
    This is the approach used in the linked_list_allocator crate, also called /pool allocation/. In this approach we store information about the freed region in the region itself. An unbound list can be built by adding a pointer to the next node of freed memory. In this approach we only need a pointer to the first unused region. The resulting data structure is often called a /free list/.
  - Fixed-Size Block Allocator
    Similar to Linked List approach, but uses a separate list for each block size (for example 16, 64 and 512). The problem with this approach is it causes unutilized memory due to the need to round up upon allocation.
    variations:
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation][slab allocator]] - this is the first design that came to mind, should definitely investigate, often combined with other allocators. the basic idea is that you map block sizes that correspond directly to selected types in the Kernel - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern][object pool pattern]]
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation][buddy allocator]] - instead of a linked-list, uses a binary-tree data structure with power-of-2 block sizes. often combined with slab allocator.
- Async/Await
  in this post we explore multitasking. worth noting that every system starts with 1 CPU core (before initializing the others).
  - /Preemptive Multitasking/ - uses OS functionality to switch threads at arbitrary points by forcibly pausing them
    Guarantees each task gets a fair share of the CPU time, without the need to trust tasks to cooperate.
    The issue is that each task requires its own stack. This concept is still important because it make it possible to run untrusted userspace programs.  In this post we focus on cooperative multitasking.
  - /Cooperative Multitasking/ - requires tasks to regularly give up control of the CPU to allow other tasks to make progress.
    often used at the language level in the form of async/await and coroutines, and in combination with async operations. The issue with these is the possibility of uncooperative tasks that abuse their consumption. They do have strong performance and are a good approach /within/ a program.

  - in Rust
    - Futures
      a future represents a value that might not be ready yet. Futures make it possible to continue execution until the value is needed.
      #+begin_src rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
      #+end_src

    We go into the problems of self-referrential structs and present some solutions. Rust uses the only zero-cost option: /Forbid moving the struct/ - this isolates handling to the type system, but leaves the burden of performing move operations on potentially self-referrential structs to the programmer. Because of this, the pinning API was proposed in [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2349-pin.md][RFC 2349]].

    Pinning is important because most Futures are self-referrential and they take a Pin<&mut Self> parameter. This ensures that the futures are not moved in memory in between =poll= calls. Running many Futures in a system is often managed by an Executor, optionally with a =thread pool= that uses =work stealing= to balance load between the CPU cores. To avoid the overhead of polling futures executors typically take advantage of the =Waker= API supported by Rust's Futures.

    The Waker is initialized by the executor and used by the task to notify the executor that its task has completed. In essence, this system provides a type of cooperative multitasking.
  - Implementation
    Futures and async/await are no_std compatible, so nothing special to be done in the src.

#+CAPTION: Bytes vs Vec<u8>
#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
The goal of Bytes is to provide a robust byte array structure for
network programming. The biggest feature it adds over Vec<u8> is
shallow cloning. In other words, calling clone() on a Bytes instance
does not copy the underlying data. Instead, a Bytes instance is a
reference-counted handle to some underlying data. The Bytes type is
roughly an Arc<Vec<u8>> but with some added capabilities.

- Always use =web-sys= package for new projects. =stdweb= isn't
  maintained and Yew has frozen support for this feature as of v0.18.0
- [[https://yew.rs/concepts/components][Components]] are the building block of a Yew application and created
  by implementing the =Component= trait for a type.
- The =Component= trait provides the Lifecycle methods used to control
  state of components.
   - Methods
      - create
      - view
      - rendered
      - update
      - change
      - destroy
   - Associated Types
     The =Component= trait has two associated types: =Message= and =Properties=.
      - The Message type is often an enum, where each variant is
        associated with a specific event
      - Properties represent information that is passed down to a
        child component from its parent. It's usually a struct, used
        while creating and updating a component, and can specify sets
        of required or optional fields.
- [[https://yew.rs/concepts/components/callbacks][Callbacks]]
  Components are able to create callbacks and self-update via the component "link".

   - css-in-rust isn't maintained (much at least), forks are coming out
   - there are many yew 'component libraries' for popular CSS frameworks.
      - I use [[https://crates.io/crates/ybc][ybc]] (BulmaCSS) for my website, for example.
- In my opinion, the future state of UI is not in web-specific
  frameworks. This will be more apparent once native WebAssembly is
  fully supported in browsers without JS APIs, and developers can
  confidently write WASM bindings without interop concerns with
  different platforms.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages out there
coming in at [[https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php][#2 in popularity and growing as of 2021]]. It is a
dynamically-typed, garbage-collected language with simple, very
readable syntax. It is well-maintained with a vast community of
developers.

It is an [[file:oop.org][OOP]]-based interpretted programming language based on C.

- One of the draws of Python is the ease in which you can just 'get
  something done' quickly. CTFers and other types of competitive
  hackers prefer it for precisely this reason.

- Another advantage is the ease in which Python can be understood by
  humans, making it a great beginner language for anyone. This also
  makes it a great choice for Research and Academic fields where
  non-programmers are involved, as source code snippets can be
  included in your work with minimal explanation.

Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a
long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix
notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest
high-level programming language. Only Fortran is older, by one
year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects
have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose
Lisp dialects are Racket, Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure.

Three major components:

- *scsynth*, a real-time audio server, forms the core of the
  platform. It features 400+ unit generators (“UGens”) for analysis,
  synthesis, and processing. Its granularity allows the fluid
  combination of many known and unknown audio techniques, moving
  between additive and subtractive synthesis, FM, granular synthesis,
  FFT, and physical modeling. You can write your own UGens in C++, and
  users have already contributed several hundred more to the
  sc3-plugins repository.

- *sclang*, an interpreted programming language. It is focused on sound,
  but not limited to any specific domain. sclang controls scsynth via
  Open Sound Control. You can use it for algorithmic composition and
  sequencing, finding new sound synthesis methods, connecting your app
  to external hardware including MIDI controllers, network music,
  writing GUIs and visual displays, or for your daily programming
  experiments. It has a stock of user-contributed extensions called
  Quarks.

- *scide* is an editor for sclang with an integrated help system.

     Tacit programming does not use variables during the execution of
     a function (but you might use them for convenience in order to
     construct a tacit program). Variables allow you to use any
     accessible value in the program with the same level of
     ease. Tacit code doesn't. In fact it becomes pretty unusable when
     more than about three values are active at once. One consequence
     is that tacit code won't cause confusion by modifying far-away
     variables. But something unique to the tacit paradigm is that
     when only a small number of values are active—which is always
     true in a small enough portion of a program!—it has more powerful
     ways to describe the way these values flow through the
     program. The main way it achieves this is with combinators.

     a fleeting instant by the course of code, and bind it. Tie it
     down with a name, failing always to alter its inner nature but
     allowing context to reform its outer appearance. So labelled,
     perhaps through the progress of time it will know escape, or else
     find itself passed through one bond to another, ever
     tethered. It's a task to be approached only with respect.

  CBQN is the primary offline implementation - there is
  also a mostly usable javascript implementation.

  #+begin_quote
  Probably you can figure out the easy things like calling
  bqn("×´1+↕6") to compute six factorial. But how do you get JS and
  BQN to talk to each other, for example to compute the factorial of a
  number n? Constructing a source string with bqn("×´1+↕"+n) isn't the
  best way—in fact I would recommend you never use this strategy.

  Instead, return a function from BQN and call it:
  bqn("{×´1+↕𝕩}")(n). This strategy also has the advantage that you
  can store the function, so that it will only be compiled
  once. Define let fact = bqn("{×´1+↕𝕩}"); at the top of your program
  and use it as a function elsewhere.

  In computerized society where individuality is diminished, there are
  those who find little or no satisfaction in strict conformity to
  stereotyped thinking and are searching for their own answers to
  life's questions and how best to live, work and find inspiration.

  Although little is known about what transpired during his brief
  visit to the Northern Venice, the idea Arthur conceived during that
  trip is much better known — he had a clear and uncompromising vision
  of a new system.

  In 1992, Whitney departed from Morgan Stanley to fully concentrate
  on the design of a new computer language.

First, clone the repo:
#+begin_src shell :results silent
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git /tmp/emacs
#+end_src

Once the source is in hand, I strongly recommend making a separate
build directory and calling the configure script from there.

#+begin_src shell
mkdir /tmp/emacs-build && cd /tmp/emacs-build
../emacs/configure --with-mailutils --with-imagemagick --with-x-toolkit=athena --without-pop --without-sound --with-json --enable-link-time-optimization --with-native-compilation
NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 make -j8
# test the build with './src/emacs' (location of output binary)
# install emacs binaries on current system
make install
#+end_src

The =configure= script takes a bunch of different flags that
customize the build, and generate a build-specific Makefile.

The next line compiles the source. Install with =make install= and
you're done! A custom Emacs binary with all the fixings has just
been installed for your current user. :)

Here are some of the other configuration flags worth investigating:

- --without-all
- --with-x-toolkit=no
- --without-x
- --without-dbus --without-gconf --without-gsettings

Org-mode is a flexible text-based note-taking system built for [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]].

It's one of the best packages available in the Emacs ecosystem and
really pushes the boundaries of what simple 'text-files' are capable
of. It can be intimidating at first look, but if you keep diving down
the rabbit-hole it feels like a whole new world is opened up to
you.

My usage of org-mode revolves around the following principles:
- /Documentation is highly valuable/ - There is no religion without a
  prophet.
- /Workflows are not stable/ - There is no one-size-fits-all solution
  to workflow management. Org-mode configurations will change over
  time, and that's ok. It also allows us to keep with the latest
  trends in the community 87).
- /Inspect and Adapt/ - I have weekly review seshes to take a glimpse
  at my current workflow from afar, and jot down a list of things that
  work, and things that don't. Good habit to get into for serious
  usage.

- configure - modify params (done via NixExpr)
- deploy - deploy configuration to target machines (NixOps/Disnix)
- build - build a configuration
- run - run a package (nix-shell run)

***** Arch Linux desktop example

Here's a few widgets I set up - they stay on the desktop behind all my other windows, so
when I want to see some quick stats I can just switch to an empty tag in AwesomeWM
(which is also configured via Lua).

Using conky is very easy. It takes a few flags to run in the background smoothly and a
config file as input.

As a shell script:
#+begin_src shell
#!/bin/sh
conky -bdc ~/.config/conky/conky-l1.lua &
conky -bdc ~/.config/conky/conky-l2.lua &
#+end_src

Or in Rust:
#+begin_src rust
use cmd_lib::{run_cmd, CmdResult};

/// start conky service in background
#[cfg(unix)]
pub fn conky(cfg: &str) -> CmdResult {
  Ok(run_cmd!(conky  -qbdc "$cfg" '&')?)
}
#+end_src

Next thing I want to do is mess with [[https://github.com/varingst/awesome-conky][awesome-conky]] to get an idea of how to better
integrate with AwesomeWM, then make some better widgets. :)

Roam is a "note-taking tool for networked thought". According to the website:

#+begin_quote
As easy to use as a document. As powerful as a graph database.
Roam helps you organize your research for the long haul.
#+end_quote

This is a very interesting concept which closely resembles the
personal-wiki/mind-dump applications that currently exist, perhaps
with a focus on research.

This is a paid web-based service, so not something we're interested
in, but overall a good continuation of the mind-mapping framework.

Version Control (or revision control, source control, source code
management..) most commonly refers to the practice of /managing
changes/ to computer programs, documents, or other collections of
information.

The 'Version' in Version Control refers to a specific state of the
/repository/, often represented as a [[file:hash.org][hash]] key. This key is used to
identify these 'Versions' in a given Version Control System.

     - pulling changesets can be incredibly slow at times
     - unlike vanilla hg, pulling from a git repo with hggit does NOT
       support revision CLI flag ('-r 100' will not work), so the
       standard method of doing an incremental pull is not possible
     - expect unexpected behaviors. always have backups.
  - hggit will often pull the 'github-pages' branch from repos using

[[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] and [[https://www.mercurial-scm.org/][Mercurial]] are two different tools with the same job, it has just been my
experience that Mercurial does them a little bit better for my workflow, and I am able
to build things faster using it.

- Mercurial is designed to provide tools for /building/ a DVCS, and encourages you to
  expand your knowledge about the system to reap the benefits it provides. With Git I
  found myself often avoiding the implementation details in favor of quick-fixes and
  ugly scripts. On the other hand, I feel much more comfortable /designing/ a solution
  with the tools Mercurial provides.

- the Mercurial system has features such as immutable commits and branches, which can be
  quite dangerous. There are ways to 'fix' changes made by these commands, but they go
  against the grain of the rest of the system. Git on the other hand lets you seamlessly
  edit commits and close branches, which can be life-savers when Billy the Intern
  commits to master.

- Mercurial also has superior features for exporting native repository to different DVCS
  (Git, Darcs, SVN), making it more useful in scenarios where a repo needs to be shared
  with users or tools that are unfamiliar with the 'hg' command.

- Overall, the choice is a personal one. Over time I have felt less constrained, as if
  there were less rules to follow with Mercurial. This is a far-cry from my first
  experience with it, where I felt the complete opposite.

****** Web Hosting
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       90aeedf8-86d9-4ef7-81e1-b22417ba58d9
:CUSTOM_ID: web-hosting
:END:
Hosting with vanilla Mercurial is quite similar to vanilla Git. =hg serve= is basically
the equivalent to =git instaweb=. Where they differ is in the out-of-box solutions - Git
has cgit, GitLab, Gitolite, git.sr.ht, etc. Mercurial has hg.sr.ht, and just recently
Heptapod, which is not production-ready.

My experience with self-hosting the sr.ht eco-system was far from a good one due to
conflicting dependencies, package manager incompatibility, and some classic PHP
craziness. The Heptapod docker container took eons just to build tests, so I just gave
up on that for now but will be on the look out for new developments with that
project. So what we're really left with is the built-in tools. Lucky for us, we have the
[[https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/PublishingRepositories#hgweb][hgweb]] scripts at our disposal.

Here's the relevant docs covering all topics in this section. They are all must-reads if
you plan on exposing a Mercurial server to the public.

- hgweb + wsgi + nginx \\
  The hgweb script is used for deployment of the server via CGI or WSGI. The WSGI setup
  is a bit more involved, but according to the docs:
  #+begin_quote
  (!) Much better performance can be achieved by using WSGI instead of CGI.
  #+end_quote

  This section covers the WSGI (pronounced /whis/-/gee/) setup, specifically for
  Nginx. The docs have better examples for Apache servers, so you do need to go off the
  beaten path to find just the right values to set in Nginx. The following setup worked
  for https://hg.rwest.io running Arch Linux.

  - dependencies \\
    - =uwsgi= and =uwsgi-plugin-python= are required for the hgweb.wsgi script.
    - =nginx= is used here, but...
    - =apache= package is needed if you want to use ~htpasswd~ while setting up HTTP
      Authentication. SSH auth only or public hosts don't need this.
  - /etc/uwsgi/hgweb.ini \\
    This is a UWSGI service configuration file - the =hgweb.wsgi= script needs to be
    located in the directory specified by =chdir=. If you are using systemd, try
    enabling the service with =systemctl enable uwsgi@hgweb.service=, and check the logs
    for any errors. The service calls the hgweb.wsgi script, which serves all repos
    configured via =hgweb.conf=.
    #+begin_example
    [uwsgi]
    master = true
    ; max-requests = 1000
    ; logto = {log file path}/hgweb-uwsgi.log
    uid = hgweb ; set process owner
    gid = hgweb
    stats = /run/uwsgi/stats.sock
    chmod-socket = 666
    cap = setgid,setuid
    ; https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/PublishRepositoriesOnNginx
    plugins = python
    socket = /run/uwsgi/hgweb.sock
    chdir = /home/hgweb/hg
    wsgi-file = hgweb.wsgi
    ; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15878176/uwsgi-invalid-request-block-size
    ; http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ThingsToKnow.html
    ; buffer-size = 65535
    #+end_example

  - hgweb.wsgi \\
    The config path must be a byte string, and an absolute path. This script needs to be
    in the same directory as =hgweb.conf=.
    #+begin_src python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    config = b"/home/hgweb/hgweb.conf"
    # Uncomment to send python tracebacks to the browser if an error occurs:
    #import cgitb; cgitb.enable()
    # enable demandloading to reduce startup time
    from mercurial import demandimport; demandimport.enable()
    from mercurial.hgweb import hgweb
    application = hgweb(config)
    #+end_src

  - hgweb.conf \\
    Mercurial web server configuration file. Setting staticurl to =/static= allows us to
    pass serving of static content to Nginx, which is faster and has better caching
    controls.
    #+begin_example
    [web]
    encoding = UTF-8
    baseurl = https://hg.rwest.io
    contact = some_dude
    templates = theme
    style = spartan
    logourl = https://rwest.io
    staticurl = /static
    descend = True
    collapse = True
    [paths]
    / = src/*
    #+end_example

  - /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hg.conf \\
    Note that none of the extra uwsgi params from mercurial docs are used here, only the
    default uwsgi_params files provided by Nginx.
    #+begin_example
    server {
      server_name hg.rwest.io;
      listen 443 ssl;
      ssl_certificate fullchain.pem;

Virtualization (or more specifically, hardware virtualization) is a

In software development, the host computer shares its resources with
individual VMs by using a /hypervisor/ or /virtual machine manager/
(VMM).

Virtualization technology is constanty evolving, and we likely have a
long way to go before we get it right, but the increase in popularity
that is likely due to the use of virtualization in microservice/web

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In a radio receiver circuit, the RF front end is a generic term for all the circuitry between a receiver's antenna input up to and including the mixer stage.[1] It consists of all the components in the receiver that process the signal at the original incoming radio frequency (RF), before it is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF). In microwave and satellite receivers it is often called the low-noise block (LNB) or low-noise downconverter (LND) and is often located at the antenna, so that the signal from the antenna can be transferred to the rest of the receiver at the more easily handled intermediate frequency.

For most superheterodyne architectures, the RF front end consists of:[2]

A band-pass filter (BPF) to reduce image response. This removes any signals at the image frequency, which would otherwise interfere with the desired signal. It also prevents strong out-of-band signals from saturating the input stages.
An RF amplifier, often called the low-noise amplifier (LNA). Its primary responsibility is to increase the sensitivity of the receiver by amplifying weak signals without contaminating them with noise, so that they can stay above the noise level in succeeding stages. It must have a very low noise figure (NF). The RF amplifier may not be needed and is often omitted (or switched off) for frequencies below 30 MHz, where the signal-to-noise ratio is defined by atmospheric and man-made noise.
A local oscillator (LO) which generates a radio frequency signal at an offset from the incoming signal, which is mixed with the incoming signal.
The mixer, which mixes the incoming signal with the signal from the local oscillator to convert the signal to the intermediate frequency (IF).#+END_QUOTE

description by John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a
Report on the EDVAC. That document describes a design architecture
for an electronic digital computer with these components:

- A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
- A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter
- Memory that stores data and instructions
- External mass storage
- Input and output mechanisms

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model
- A distributed application architecture model

- The term 'work' is used to describe the inputs and outputs of such a
  model. The 'work' performed is strictly scoped.
   - For example, consider the architecture for an MMO video game. The
     client-server model applies to the design of Players (=Clients=)
     connecting to a match, which is hosted on the game server
     (=Server=). The 'work' performed here may include updates to a
     Player's in-game position based on control input, chat messages,
     connection status, etc.
   - In addition to communicating with the game server, Players may
     establish direct connection to other Players in their match in a
     /client-to-client/ or /decentralized/ manner, where 'work' is
     shared and managed between the =Clients= themselves, under
     authority of the =Server=. This is where terminology begins to

  #+begin_quote
  Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that
  partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent
  participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. 

  Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network
  bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central
  coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of
  resources, in contrast to the traditional client–server model in which the consumption and
  supply of resources is divided.

:END:
   - *UDP and TCP share the same space* in a network stack and operate
     on top of the IP protocol.
   - *UDP has no built-in notion of State*, TCP does. However,
     stateless protocols can be built on lower-level stateful
     ones.. and vice-versa. It's just a matter of abstraction.
	 - for example =HTTP= is a /stateless/ protocol, built
       on TCP (/stateful/), which is built on IP (/stateless/)
   - *TCP provides connection guarantees* that a client receives
     packets IN ORDER and exactly in the condition they were sent
     (thanks to checksums in headers), at the cost of some performance
     (to ensure packet sequencing, checking headers, establishing
     connection, etc)
     - *UDP does NOT provide connection guarantees*.
       - UDP does have checksums though, and thus
         ensures packets are received in same
         condition that they were sent.
     - Packets can be sent and lost, it doesn't intrinsically matter
       in UDP that the client didn't receive them.
     - The loss of built-in guarantees does come with a performance
       boost though, as well as a network protocol that is quite
       flexible in its simplicity.

#+begin_quote
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol
for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed
for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can
also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical
client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a
request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a
stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data
(state) between two requests. Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it
can be used on any reliable transport layer, that is, a protocol that
doesn't lose messages silently like UDP does. RUDP — the reliable
update of UDP — is a suitable alternative.

Disk storage (also sometimes called drive storage) is a general
category of storage mechanisms where data is recorded by various
electronic, magnetic, optical, or mechanical changes to a surface
layer of one or more rotating disks. A disk drive is a device
implementing such a storage mechanism. Notable types are the hard disk
drive (HDD) containing a non-removable disk, the floppy disk drive
(FDD) and its removable floppy disk, and various optical disc drives
(ODD) and associated optical disc media.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the
tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML
covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable
machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an artificial
intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying
machine learning.
The high degree of automation in AutoML allows non-experts to make use
of machine learning models and techniques without requiring them to
become experts in machine learning. Automating the process of applying
machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of
producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and
models that often outperform hand-designed models. AutoML has been
used to compare the relative importance of each factor in a prediction
model.

  - random thoughts on knowledge ::
    First of all, what the hell is /Knowledge/? Why it is something we
    know, of course! /But seriously/.. it depends on who you talk to.
    - The lawyer will say it's an understanding of a thing
    - The economist will say it's information about a thing
    - The philosopher will say they don't know
  
    At least Plato had a catchy definition for us: a "justified true
    belief". However, it is well understood nowadays that this one-liner
    doesn't suffice. Some smug epistemologist may tell you it's a
    "cluster concept", or that it is simply an artifact of natural
    language, referring only to a degree of conviction. Both excellent
    ways of dodging the question.
  
    In pursuit of practicality let's ignore the philosopher and focus on
    the remaining definitions..
    - an understanding of a thing
    - information about a thing
    Nice, and now - a magic trick:
    - an understanding of a /thing/ we have information about
    
    Information is cultivated to develop Knowledge. This knowledge can be
    used to develop even more Knowledge, or revise existing Knowledge.
  
    This is our lazy compromise between the two - composed of an output
    (an understanding) and an input (information). We'll refer to this
    definition when talking about /Knowledge Management/, which is simply
    a process of turning our input into an output and looping over that
    output.

A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or

to one direction. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave
intensities decrease according to the inverse square law as they expand into
